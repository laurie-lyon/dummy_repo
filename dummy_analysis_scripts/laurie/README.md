## How to organize a README in my personal folder 

README in my personal folder for a collaborate project should give a general overview of the scripts within. Use .md suffix to indicate a Markdown File

For each function or script within my folder: 
  - function/script 1
    - path: \laurie\script1.py
    - what is the starting point or input
    - what the function or script does
    - why this funciton was created
   
Also include a data folder with data a user could run the script on
