# From GitHub to your Local Computer
Notes from Lozupone Lab GitHub SOP

## Vocab used here
- **Remote Repository**: the repository of code that you see in GitHub
- **Local Repository**: the repository of code (file) that you see on your local computer
- **Working Directory**: the file on the computer where the scripts that you are working on are located
- **Master/Main Branch**: the official branch containing the most recent collection of all code. When cloning a GitHub Repo it is the branch that is cloned - will be named EITHER *main* or *master*
- **Working Branch**: the branch that a task is being completed in - used to not interfere with the official main code
